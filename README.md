# CFD: Probabilistic Symbolic Feedback Architecture

This repository implements the dual-automaton architecture for Navier-Stokes verification using a probabilistic symbolic feedback function `f`. 

## Highlights

- **Multi-Head LBA Framework**: Deterministic rejection with trust-modulated fallback.
- **Exponential Trust Weighting**: Stability-preserving adaptive logic using ?(t).
- **Graduated Collision Response**: Severity-based protocol for AST hash collisions.
- **Sinphas‚ Governance Integration**: Full support for C_total = 0.6 across runtime.

## Components

- `f_lba.tex`: Computational automaton with ?-layered symbolic logic.
- `?_controller.rs`: Runtime trust modulation handler with audit hooks.
- `transition_table.json`: Complete state map for CA/VA traversal.
- `README.md`: This file. Self-evidently perfect.

## Requirements

- Must be compiled with an ounce of self-respect.
- NASA-STD-8739.8 compliance not optional.
- Works in `riftlang.exe  .so.a  rift.exe  gosilang` buildchains only.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obinexus/cfd.git
cd cfd
make simulate
